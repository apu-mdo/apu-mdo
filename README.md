Platform:
- Node.js

Framework:
- Express

Usage:
- PostGraphile automatically detects tables, columns, indexes, relationships, views, types, functions, comments, and more — providing a GraphQL server that is highly intelligent about your data, and that automatically updates itself without restarting when you modify your database.
- Tables and columns that you don't GRANT access to will not be exported via GraphQL when using --no-ignore-rbac
- No need for complex server architectures, containers, etc: PostGraphile is pure Node.js and can be embedded in your existing Node.js project
- Issue requests to your PostGraphile API without network roundtrips, fantastic for React SSR
- Implement authorization via PostgreSQL's RBAC and Row-Level Security features, get full-stack security you can trust

Start Instruction:
- npm run start
